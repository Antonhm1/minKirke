# Automated UI Workflow for Church App Development

## 🎯 Overview

This system provides **automated UI testing and iterative development feedback** when working on the church web app. Instead of manually testing each change, the system automatically:

1. **Tests UI changes** after each modification
2. **Takes screenshots** to track progress
3. **Validates functionality** against expected behavior
4. **Provides feedback** and recommendations
5. **Guides next steps** based on test results

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automated Development Loop

```
1. Start UI Workflow Session
   ↓
2. Make UI Changes
   ↓
3. Auto-test Changes
   ↓
4. Get Instant Feedback
   ↓
5. Iterate Based on Results
   ↓
6. Repeat until Complete
```

## 🛠️ Available MCP Tools

### Session Management
- `start_ui_workflow` - Begin automated testing session
- `end_ui_workflow` - End session and generate report
- `ui_workflow_status` - Check current workflow status

### Testing & Validation
- `test_ui_change` - Test UI after making changes
- `quick_ui_check` - Quick validation of current state
- `iterate_component` - Iteratively test specific components

### Manual Controls (still available)
- `take_screenshot` - Manual screenshot capture
- `click_element` - Manual element interaction
- `launch_browser` - Manual browser control

## 📋 Example Usage Patterns

### 1. Starting a Development Session

**You say:**
> "I'm going to work on the EventCard component. Start a UI workflow session."

**Claude uses:**
```
start_ui_workflow(description: "EventCard component development")
```

**Result:**
- Browser launches and navigates to your app
- Initial baseline tests run
- Screenshots taken of current state
- Ready for iterative development

### 2. After Making Code Changes

**You say:**
> "I just added the EventCard component with title and description fields. Test the changes."

**Claude uses:**
```
test_ui_change(changeDescription: "Added EventCard component with title and description")
```

**Result:**
- Tests run automatically
- Screenshots captured
- Validation results provided
- Recommendations for next steps

### 3. Component-Specific Iteration

**You say:**
> "Let's iterate on the EventCard component until it's working properly."

**Claude uses:**
```
iterate_component(
  componentName: "EventCard",
  expectedFeatures: [
    { selector: "[data-testid='event-card']", description: "Event card container" },
    { selector: ".event-title", description: "Event title element" },
    { selector: ".event-description", description: "Event description" }
  ]
)
```

**Result:**
- Multiple test iterations
- Component-specific validation
- Progress tracking
- Automated feedback loop

## 🔄 Iterative Development Example

### Real Development Session Flow

```
🚀 Start Session
├── test_ui_change("Added basic HTML structure")
│   ├── ❌ EventCard not found
│   └── 💡 Recommendation: Create EventCard component
│
├── test_ui_change("Created EventCard component")
│   ├── ✅ EventCard found
│   ├── ❌ Title missing
│   └── 💡 Recommendation: Add title element
│
├── test_ui_change("Added event title")
│   ├── ✅ EventCard found
│   ├── ✅ Title found
│   ├── ❌ Description missing
│   └── 💡 Recommendation: Add description
│
└── 🏁 End Session
    └── 📊 Report: 85% success rate, 3 iterations
```

- **Iteration Count** - Number of development cycles
- **Progress Speed** - Time between iterations
- **Component Completion** - Feature implementation status

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Ensure Setup
```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
npm run dev

# MCP server should be configured in Claude Desktop
```

### 2. Start Development Session
> "Start a UI workflow session for [component/feature name]"

### 3. Begin Iterating
> "I just [made changes]. Test the UI changes."

### 4. Follow Recommendations
> "Iterate on the [ComponentName] until it's complete."

### 5. End Session
> "End the UI workflow and show me the report."

## 🔧 Advanced Usage
