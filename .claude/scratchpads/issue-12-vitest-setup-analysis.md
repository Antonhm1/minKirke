**Issue Link**: https://github.com/antonhm1/my-app/issues/12
**Status**: Already Complete âœ…
**Date**: 2025-09-15

## Issue Summary

**Title**: ðŸ§ª Setup Vitest unit testing framework
**Goal**: Configure Vitest for unit and integration testing

## Acceptance Criteria Analysis

### âœ… 1. Vitest configuration file created
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Evidence**:
- `vitest.config.ts` exists with comprehensive configuration
- Includes jsdom environment for React testing
- Proper include/exclude patterns for test files
- React plugin integration configured

### âœ… 2. Test scripts in package.json
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Evidence**:
- `test: "vitest"` - Basic test runner
- `test:unit: "vitest run --reporter=verbose --coverage src/utils src/hooks"` - Unit tests with coverage
- `test:components: "vitest run --reporter=verbose --coverage src/components"` - Component tests
- `test:ci: "vitest run --coverage && playwright test"` - CI pipeline tests
- `test:watch: "vitest"` - Watch mode for development

### âœ… 3. Sample test file to verify setup
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Evidence**:
- `src/utils/example.test.ts` exists with working test cases
- Uses proper Vitest syntax (`describe`, `it`, `expect`)
- Tests pass successfully (verified by running `npm test`)

### âœ… 4. Coverage reporting configured (80% threshold)
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Evidence**:
- Coverage provider: v8
- Multiple reporters: text, json, html, lcov
- 80% thresholds configured for:
  - Branches: 80%
  - Functions: 80%
  - Lines: 80%
  - Statements: 80%
- Proper include/exclude patterns for coverage collection

## Additional Features Already Present

### Testing Infrastructure
- âœ… **Test Setup File**: `src/test/setup.ts` with comprehensive mocks:
  - DOM mocks (matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver)
  - Environment variable mocks
  - Automatic cleanup after each test
- âœ… **React Testing Library Integration**: Full setup with jest-dom matchers
- âœ… **MSW Integration**: Mock Service Worker for API testing
- âœ… **E2E Testing**: Playwright configured for end-to-end tests

### Dependencies
All required testing dependencies are installed:
- `vitest@2.1.8`
- `@testing-library/react@16.1.0`
- `@testing-library/jest-dom@6.6.3`
- `@testing-library/user-event@14.5.2`
- `@vitest/coverage-v8@2.1.8`
- `@vitest/ui@2.1.8`
- `jsdom@25.0.1`
- `msw@2.6.8`

## Test Results
```
âœ“ src/utils/example.test.ts (2 tests) 2ms
Test Files  1 passed (1)
Tests  2 passed (2)
Duration  685ms
```

## Conclusion

**Issue #12 is already completely implemented.** All acceptance criteria have been met and the testing framework is fully functional. The project has a comprehensive testing setup that exceeds the requirements:

1. âœ… Vitest configuration exists and works
2. âœ… Test scripts are properly configured
3. âœ… Sample tests exist and pass
4. âœ… Coverage reporting configured with 80% thresholds
5. âœ… Additional benefits: React Testing Library, MSW, E2E testing, comprehensive mocks

**Recommendation**: Close issue #12 as completed, as no further work is required.
